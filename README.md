### Introduction
This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593), which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.
